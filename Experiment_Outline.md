Experiment Goals:

Collect Drone RF data in a noise free environment for detection purtposes including RF spectrum analysis and machine learning methods regarding drone behavior.

Time required:
1-2 hours 

Plan:
Use a HackRF, a laptop with GNU radio, and a provided DJI drone to collect RF spectrum data using HackRF Sweep for processing outside of the lab. The drone would be powered but not moving. Data will be collected from various distances and time intervals by moving the HackRF and the drone controller away and around the lab (lab size unknown).
