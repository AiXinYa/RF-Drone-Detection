# Experiment Goals

We plan to use a HackRF One software defined radio to collect drone RF data in a low noise environment. The aim of our project is to prototype a drone detection system for the Georgia Tech Police Department. The system will use a software defined radio for RF spectrum analysis and apply machine learning methods to detect drone RF activiity. Capturing a drone's RF communication in a low noise environment will allow us to narrow down the most effective detection methods to implement for the GTPD.


# Experiment Parameters

Time required: 1-2 hours


We are primarily interested in the 2.4 Ghz frequency range. If time allows, we would also like to collect data in the 900 Mhz and 5.8 Ghz ranges.

*We would like to record this data with a couple different antenna's, but definitely need to ensure use at least one directional and one omni-directional*

# Experiment Plan 1  
RF Detection

Use a HackRF, a laptop with GNU radio, and a provided DJI drone to collect RF spectrum data using HackRF Sweep for processing outside of the lab. The drone would be powered but not moving. Data will be collected from various distances and time intervals by moving the HackRF and the drone controller away and around the lab, if the size of the lab permits.

Before each recording we want to:
- Record environment noise for about 1 minute before starting our actual recording, to ensure we have an accurate control reading of the noise in the environment
(hackrf_sweep -f (lower_range):(upper range) -n 8192 -w 600000 -r control_{n}.csv)
- copy output file to another machine (Tegra has limited storage)
- Perform the actual recording

Recordings we want to obtain:
1. One minute of RF activity in which we know the drone is running (Full spectrum we think it could be operating in) 
(hackrf_sweep -f (lower_bound):(upper_bound) -n 8192 -w 600000 -r active_drone.csv)
2. A recording of RF activity as someone walks WITH the drone on from right next to the hackrf to about 100m away (Where ever we see activity from 1)
3. A recording of RF activity as someone walks with the drone from about 100m away to the hackRF (same spectrum as 2)

# Experiment Plan 2  
RF Sonar

- Collect RF data of drone movement using a 2.4Ghz 20dBi gain directional antenna.  
- Identify the drone's wifi channel using a Wifi Analyzer and a spectrum analyzer.  
- This application provides the channel ID and frequency for listening to the droneâ€™s communication.  
- Store the data for filtering in python.  


# Experiment plan 3
**Moving body drone data**

__Ensure this entire experiment has someone filming the drone__

1. Using the information from wifi-analyzer, use a hackRF to listen to the data being transmitted by the drone. 
Record the following data:
  a. Starting with the drone not moving (propellers still)
  
Turn on the propellers and stay on ground for roughly 5 seconds

  b. Take off hovering for roughly 5 seconds
  
  c. Move the drone in a t shape, returning to center after reaching each edge.

In a Separate Recording of both RF and video:

a. Again start with a still drone

b. Take off with the drone

c. While hovering in a relatively fixed location, rotate drone 360 degrees around.

d. Navigate the drone in a circle

e. Tilt drone on all axis



__Repeat recordings with an omni-directional and a directional antenna (preferably one with a more narrow angle, and one with a wider angle).__
