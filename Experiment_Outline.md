# Experiment Goals

Use a HackRF One to collect drone RF data in a noise-free environment for detection purposes, including RF spectrum analysis and machine learning methods regarding drone RF behavior.


# Experiment Parameters

Time required: 1-2 hours


We are primarily interested in the 2.4 Ghz frequency range. If time allows, we would also like to collect data in the 900 Mhz and 5.8 Ghz ranges.

# Experiment Plan

Use a HackRF, a laptop with GNU radio, and a provided DJI drone to collect RF spectrum data using HackRF Sweep for processing outside of the lab. The drone would be powered but not moving. Data will be collected from various distances and time intervals by moving the HackRF and the drone controller away and around the lab, if the size of the lab permits.
