Findings:
1. We can feed detectable features to a neural net or some other form of ML algorithm to increase detection accuracy. 
2. Drones are very obvious on the RF spectrum, when activated, put out a lot of power
3. Features we can use include RF frequency, drone vibration, doppler signature, wavelet analysis, temporal consistency, coefficient variances, body shifting patterns, and moving object detection.
4. HackRF sweep samples fast enough that we will be able to detect frequency hopping drones without trouble
